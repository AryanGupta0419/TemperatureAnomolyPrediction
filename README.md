# TemperatureAnomolyPrediction

Developed a spatio-temporal climate prediction model using a hybrid U-Net and ConvLSTM architecture with self-attention, trained on NASA GISTEMP anomaly data. Implemented data preprocessing with xarray, temporal sequence creation, and augmentation. Achieved accurate future temperature anomaly forecasting by modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in historical climate patterns.
